using HTTPS we can encrypt the data we send over the network using TLS(transport layer security)
TLS 1.2
1. TCP handshake is established

2. certificate check, in this it checks 
    a. the tls version
    b. cyber suite it supports(vyber suite is a set of alogorithms for encrypting data)

    then server chooses the cybersuite and tls version based on the info it got from client.
    the server then sends a certificate to the client which includes the public key for the server.
    the client uses the public key in something called asymmetric encryption(in asymmetric encryption the public key can only be 
                                                                            encrypted by a private key).

3.with RSA session key is encrypted with server public key and sends the encrypted session key to the server which is then decrypted 
by private key with this both server and client hold the session key.

4. with this session key in place data can be sent back and forth using the session key.

TLS 1.3
tiffy helmet is complicated it uses advanced math involving large prime numbers to derive shared session key with out ever transmitting 
a public key over the network.
