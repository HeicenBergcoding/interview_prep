hosting is the home of the home of your website.
If you own a website we will need somewhere to host it.

hosting is basically a network infra that keeps your website available across the internet

shared hosting
    when we share the servers with other that also use the hosting service.
    it is cheaper.
    resources are shared so huge traffic is not handled well.
    small businesses and small blogs.
    security issue - if the physical server is compromised your website is also compromised.

VPS(virtual private server)
    the resources are not shared dedicated resources are provided for each user.
    the server is being shared but the resources are isolated for each user.
    vps are known to be easlily scalable.
    with vps the hackers will have to attack your vps specifically even if another vps on the physical server is compromised.

dedicated hosting
    when user dont share resources with another user the entire physical server belongs to the user.
    it is very expensive.

Cloud hosting 
    It allows for the content of the site to be spread across multiple virtual servers across different regions, 
    and when demand increases, it is easy to scale. Because of this, cloud hosting is also more robust and reliable than web hosting, 
    while allowing for more flexibility to tune the parameters as needed.
